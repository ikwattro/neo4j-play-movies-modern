# Modern version of Neo4j's `:play movies` Cypher

## Motivation

The `:play movies` command from the Neo4j browser is a neat and fast way to create a simple graph for testing. However, Neo4j has evolved a lot and some people might need a version of the Cypher statement that includes recent Neo4j features such as : 

- Temporal data types
- Property Type constraints
- Node and Relationship Key constraints
- Uniqueness constraints on Nodes and Relationships
